option 1: try with two divs floating on each side with a blank spacer at the middle. use the same logic for responsive. use position absolute and that will change on a responsive media query.
option 2: set a wider border for container and create the effect of the image over the line
optional: how about a cool hover efect like a css3 transition?

=================================================================

General Requirements
    * Match the PSD (./creative/pld-test.psd).
      (If you don't have Photoshop, download a trial.)
    * It should look and work the same in:
        * Internet Explorer 7 and above
        * Firefox Latest
        * Safari Latest
        * Chrome Latest

Section 1
    * Obtain the text for the 5 paragraphs from the PSD.

Section 2
    * Obtain the images from the PSD.
    * Use the same ad image and the same blue circle image for both the left and
      right placement.
    * "AB" should be system text.

Section 3
    * Use unobtrusive JavaScript
    * When a user selects a date from the investment cycle drop-down box,
      the subsequent investment values must display the next three fiscal quarters.
      (e.g. for "January 2012", the subsequent quarters will be Q2 2012, Q3 2012, Q4 2012
      for "June 2012", the subsequent quarters will be Q3 2012, Q4 2012, Q1 2013.)
    * Do not hard-code the resulting quarter years in the javascript.
    * The subsequent quarters should be presented with checkboxes which are all unchecked.
    * Display the error message if the user attempts to select three checkboxes,
      and prevent the user from selecting more than two checkboxes.

Final note
    * Use your best judgment as a presentation layer developer.
