TO-DO


Plan:
-simple markup first (use html5 with html5shiv etc like test): 2h start:4:30pm looks basic at 6:30
-functionality:	4h
-look and feel details:	2h
-crossbrowser testing and fixing:	2h
-document and notes:	1h





Tips:
-comments cool subaru style
-add a little note with what you did and used: yeoman,grunt,etc

Extras:
-responsive
-cool simple design, something like http://www.razorfish.com/ maybe :) and explain in a short phrase why you choose that look and feel



How To:
------------
Section 2:
------------
option 1: try with two divs floating on each side with a blank spacer at the middle. use the same logic for responsive. use position absolute and that will change on a responsive media query.
option 2: set a wider border for container and create the effect of the image over the line
optional: how about a cool hover efect like a css3 transition?

Section 3:

    * Use unobtrusive JavaScript
    * When a user selects a date from the investment cycle drop-down box,
      the subsequent investment values must display the next three fiscal quarters.
      (e.g. for "January 2012", the subsequent quarters will be Q2 2012, Q3 2012, Q4 2012
      for "June 2012", the subsequent quarters will be Q3 2012, Q4 2012, Q1 2013.)
      	=>getCycle
      	=>updateCycle
      	=>

      	each month is located inside a quarter
      	the quarters that we need to display are the 3 subsequent eg: 
      		findNextQuarters(monthSelect, yearSelect)
      			monthQuarter = getMonthQuarter(monthSelect);
      			nextQuartersStart = monthQuarter += 1; 


      			getMonthQuarter( monthNum ){

      			}

      			getNextQuarters( date )
      			for( i<=3 )
	      		if( i >= 1 && quarters[i] == 4 ){
	      			
	      			year += 1;
	      		}
	      			quarters[1][2013]
	      			quarters[2][2013]
	      			quarters[3][2013]
	      			quarters[4][2013]
      			
			=>
      			contador de 1 a 3
      			recoge los quarter de 1 a 4
      			si llega al final (q4) y aun falta recoger quarters
      				baja el indice a 1 otra vez
      				sube el año en 1
      			continua
      			retorna array con los quarters y su año correspondiente

    * Do not hard-code the resulting quarter years in the javascript.
    * The subsequent quarters should be presented with checkboxes which are all unchecked.
    * Display the error message if the user attempts to select three checkboxes,
      and prevent the user from selecting more than two checkboxes.
